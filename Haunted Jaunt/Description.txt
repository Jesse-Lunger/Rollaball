1. Game should be complete. When I imported game it actually came complete, I then proceeded to delete components
and rebuild them according to the instructions.

2 & 3. I placed a special gargoyle in front of John Lemon that uses both dot product and linear interpolation. As
John Lemon approaches once he reaches a certain distance the Gargoyle will begin to turn. I use slerp to control
turn speed, which essentially uses dot product and linear interpolation. My initial design I used Professor Wills 
code he gave during lecture, and it was more clear it used dot product. 

4. windows->rendering->environment has a drop down tab to which you can add fog. I used this feature to give the
room a red fog.

Help recieved: I used https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYVVI58SqZU&ab_channel=MaxskeDev (youtube totrial) and also the
normal tutorial given to help me build game.
